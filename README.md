# TicketingApp
**WARNING:** the firebase link chooses to load an old ionic project sometimes. If this happens just try reloading, re-entering the url, or using the back arrow.

## Summary

This is a web application meant to simulate a ticketing app used in the IT industry. Specifically, I was inspired by Zoho Desk, which I've been using throughout my internship for my various duties.

## Features

The TicketingApp features authorization that divides the user into one of two roles: company or client.

**As a company user, you can:**

- View all tickets in the database
- Reply to tickets so that the owner can see what you need
- "Close" tickets (delete them)

**As a client user, you can:**

- View all tickets that _you_ have created, but not that other users have created
- Reply to _your_ tickets so that the company knows what you need
- "Close" _your_ tickets (delete them)

Replying to a ticket is similar to a chat system. You add a new section of text to the ticket that will be listed at the top.

## Features I Haven't Gotten To Yet

> **Timers**
> Originally, I wanted to use timers to keep track of time that a company user has worked on a ticket. Ironically, I didn't make enough time to get to this.

> **Ticket Assignment**
> I intended to have a feature where a company user could assign a ticket over to another company user, but I axed this feature in favor of 2 hours of sleep.

> **Filters**
> I also intended for company users to be able to filter through all of the tickets by the creator's name or the name of the company user the tickets were assigned to. Since I never got to assignment, I never saw th eneed to keep this feature in.

## Conclusion

All-in-all, this was a great opportunity for me to explore the deeper side of Firebase that I never got to in any other classes.

I found myself falling into a rhythm with all of the _doc_ operations by the end of it, so it's good to know that it's a part of my skillset now.

I wish I would have made more time to get to some of my experimental features, but between working every morning to noon and classes every afternoon to night my sleep schedule would have crumbled to bits. I've also had to start exploring housing options recently since my internship turned into a full-time job. I'm excited to get into the industry for real, but life-stuff takes a lot of effort to figure out.

At the end of the day, I came out of this class with a greater wealth of skills and knowledge than I did going into it, so I couldn't be happier.

Thanks for everything Todd, I'll miss you.
