## Summary
This is a web application meant to simulate a ticketing app used in the IT industry. The TicketingApp features authorization that divides the user into one of two roles: company or client.

*As a company user, you can:*
- View all tickets in the database
- Reply to tickets so that the owner can see what you need
- "Close" tickets (delete them)

*As a client user, you can:*
- View all tickets that you have created, but not that other users have created
- Reply to your tickets so that the company knows what you need
- "Close" your tickets (delete them)

Replying to a ticket is similar to a chat system. You add a new section of text to the ticket that will be listed at the top.
